Sure — here are clean interview definitions 👇

**TCP definition:**

> TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between devices.

**UDP definition:**

> UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a connectionless protocol that sends data quickly without guaranteeing delivery, order, or error recovery.

If you want, I can give:

✅ 1-line ultra-short version
✅ real-life example version
✅ easy memory trick
✅ diagram explanation
✅ interview cheat sheet

Just say 👍
Here’s a clean **interview-friendly** explanation 👇

## Simple idea first

👉 **TCP = reliable but slower**
👉 **UDP = fast but unreliable**

## Difference between TCP and UDP

| Feature        | TCP                           | UDP                    |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Full form      | Transmission Control Protocol | User Datagram Protocol |
| Connection     | Connection-oriented           | Connectionless         |
| Reliability    | ✅ Guarantees delivery         | ❌ No guarantee         |
| Speed          | Slower                        | Faster                 |
| Error checking | Yes                           | Minimal                |
| Order of data  | Maintains order               | No order guarantee     |
| Retransmission | Yes (lost packets resent)     | No retransmission      |
| Overhead       | High                          | Low                    |
| Use case       | Important data transfer       | Real-time streaming    |

## Real-world examples

**TCP used in:**

* Web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS)
* Email
* File downloads
* Banking apps

👉 accuracy is more important than speed

---

**UDP used in:**

* Video streaming
* Online gaming
* VoIP calls
* Live broadcasts

👉 speed is more important than perfection

## Simple analogy (good for interviews)

> TCP is like a phone call — you confirm every message.
> UDP is like sending letters — you send and don’t wait for confirmation.

---

## One-line interview answer

> TCP is a reliable, connection-oriented protocol that guarantees delivery and order, while UDP is a faster, connectionless protocol that sends data without guaranteeing delivery.
