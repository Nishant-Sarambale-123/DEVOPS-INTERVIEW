# ⭐ **Simple Real-Time Answer**

**Answer:**
My day starts with a **stand-up call** where we check our Jira tickets and discuss what needs to be done.
After that, I review the **Jira board**, see my assigned tasks, and check if any builds or deployments failed.

Then I look at **monitoring dashboards** (like CloudWatch or Grafana) to make sure all servers and applications are healthy.

During the day, I work on tasks like:

* fixing pipeline issues,
* updating infrastructure using Terraform/Ansible,
* helping developers with deployment problems,
* and automating repetitive tasks.

If any **incident** happens, I focus on troubleshooting it and update the Jira ticket with the progress.

I end my day by updating the Jira board, closing completed tasks, and preparing for the next day.

If you want, I can make it even shorter or tailor it to your exact tools (AWS, Jenkins, GitHub, Kubernetes, etc.).
