Here’s a clean **ready-to-say interview answer** 👇

> HTTP/1.1 is a text-based protocol where each request waits in line, which can slow performance. HTTP/2 is an improved binary version that supports multiplexing, header compression, and multiple requests over a single connection, making it faster and more efficient.

If they want shorter:

> HTTP/2 is a faster and more efficient upgrade of HTTP/1.1 that allows multiple requests in one connection and reduces latency.

If you want, I can give:

✅ 10-second version
✅ beginner version
✅ real-world example
✅ follow-up interview questions
✅ HTTP/3 explanation

Just say 👍
