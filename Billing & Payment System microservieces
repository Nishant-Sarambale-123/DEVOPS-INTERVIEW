## üîß How DevOps Fits In

As a DevOps engineer, you‚Äôd say:

* Each microservice is containerized using **Docker**.
* Deployed and managed via **Kubernetes (Helm/ArgoCD)**.
* CI/CD with **Jenkins/GitHub Actions** ensures quick releases.
* **Terraform** provisions infrastructure in AWS/Azure.
* **Prometheus + Grafana** monitor latency, failed payments, API response times.
* **ELK/Splunk** help debug failed transactions.

üëâ **Interview Tip**: Don‚Äôt just list services; **connect them with DevOps tasks**. Example:
*"I worked mainly with the **Payment Service** and **Billing Service**, ensuring their deployments on Kubernetes were reliable and monitored closely, as even small downtime could impact thousands of live transactions."*
