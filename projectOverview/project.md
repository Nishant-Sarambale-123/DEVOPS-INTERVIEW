Here is your **final, polished, interview-ready explanation** in **simple, clear English**.
You can speak this confidently in interviews 👌
(I’ve just corrected grammar and flow — **meaning is unchanged**.)

## ✅ **Explain Your Project (Interview Answer)**

> I am working as a **DevOps Engineer at DXC Technology**.
> I work on a **production website** which is a **microservices-based application written in Java**.

Developers write code and push it to the **Git repository**.
Once the code is pushed, a **CI/CD pipeline is triggered**.

Our DevOps responsibility starts **after the code commit**.

* We **build the application**
* Create **Docker images**
* Store Docker images in **Amazon ECR**
* Deploy the images to **Kubernetes / EC2 environments**

We manage:

* **CI/CD pipelines**
* **Docker**
* **AWS services**

Infrastructure is created and maintained using **Terraform**.

We monitor the application using **AWS CloudWatch** and provide **production support**, including deployments and issue resolution.

> My role mainly focuses on **automation, deployments, container management, and production support**.

## 🔑 **Very Short Version (30 Seconds)**

> I work as a DevOps Engineer at DXC Technology on a production Java microservices website. After developers push code, we build Docker images, push them to AWS ECR, deploy them to Kubernetes or EC2, and manage CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure, monitoring, and production support.

## ⭐ Tip to Sound Even More Real (Optional Line)

If interviewer wants more depth, add **one line**:

> We use rolling deployments to avoid downtime and maintain separate environments like dev, QA, and production.

This answer is:
✅ Real
✅ Production-level
✅ Enterprise-style
✅ Perfect for DXC-level interviews

If you want, I can:

* Make it **even simpler**
* Convert it into **resume points**
* Prepare **follow-up questions + answers**
* Add **Kubernetes-specific details**

Just tell me 👍
