# üìå AWS DevOps Interview Questions & Answers (AT\&T ‚Äì Billing & Payment System)

---

### 1. Tell me about your project at AT\&T.

**Answer:**
\*"I am working for AT\&T on the Billing & Payment System, which is a large-scale, customer-facing application. Millions of users log in daily to pay bills, recharge, and view invoices.

The system is built on a **microservices architecture** (Payment, Billing, Notification, Authentication, Invoice, Subscription, etc.) deployed on **Kubernetes clusters** in AWS.

As an **AWS DevOps Engineer**, my responsibilities include:

* Building CI/CD pipelines with **Jenkins** and **GitHub Actions** for automated builds, tests, and deployments.
* **Containerizing** applications using Docker and deploying via **Helm charts**.
* Using **Terraform** for Infrastructure as Code to provision AWS services like VPC, EKS, RDS, and S3.
* Setting up **monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana** and **logging with ELK/Splunk**.
* Managing secrets securely with **Vault and Kubernetes Secrets**.
* Ensuring **99.99% uptime and PCI-DSS compliance** since this is a payment-critical application."\*

---

### 2. Which microservices were part of the Billing System?

**Answer:**
\*"The Billing System was divided into several microservices such as:

* **Billing Service** ‚Äì generates customer bills.
* **Payment Service** ‚Äì processes online transactions.
* **Invoice Service** ‚Äì generates PDF invoices.
* **Notification Service** ‚Äì sends SMS/email reminders.
* **Authentication Service** ‚Äì manages user logins and security.
* **Plan & Subscription Service** ‚Äì handles user subscriptions and plan upgrades.

Each microservice was **containerized with Docker**, deployed on **Kubernetes**, and managed independently to ensure scalability and high availability."\*

---

### 3. What were your day-to-day tasks as a DevOps engineer?

**Answer:**
\*"On a daily basis, I:

* Monitored **CI/CD pipelines** in Jenkins and GitHub Actions.
* Automated new pipeline features (integration, testing, deployment).
* Maintained Kubernetes deployments (scaling, rolling updates, config changes).
* Configured monitoring alerts in **Prometheus** for latency, errors, and failed transactions.
* Troubleshot issues in production using **Grafana dashboards and ELK logs**.
* Provisioned and maintained cloud infrastructure with **Terraform**.
* Collaborated with developers to optimize Dockerfiles and Helm charts."\*

---

### 4. How do you ensure high availability in the Billing System?

**Answer:**
\*"We ensured high availability using multiple strategies:

* Kubernetes **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)** to handle sudden traffic spikes (especially for the Payment Service at month-end).
* Multi-AZ deployments on AWS EKS.
* AWS Load Balancers to distribute traffic.
* **Rolling updates** for zero-downtime deployments.
* Prometheus alerts for SLA breaches, so we could act quickly.

This combination ensured 24/7 availability and seamless customer experience."\*

---

### 5. How do you handle monitoring and logging?

**Answer:**
\*"For **monitoring**, we used **Prometheus and Grafana** to track service health ‚Äì CPU, memory, latency, and transaction success rates.

For **logging**, we used **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** and sometimes **Splunk**.

Example: If a payment transaction failed, I could trace logs in Kibana, correlate them with **Grafana metrics** for API latency, and quickly identify whether the issue was application-level or infrastructure-related."\*

---

### 6. What DevOps tools do you use in your project?

**Answer:**

* **CI/CD** ‚Äì Jenkins, GitHub Actions
* **Containerization** ‚Äì Docker
* **Orchestration** ‚Äì Kubernetes, Helm, ArgoCD (GitOps)
* **Monitoring** ‚Äì Prometheus, Grafana
* **Logging** ‚Äì ELK, Splunk
* **Infrastructure as Code** ‚Äì Terraform, Ansible
* **Security** ‚Äì Vault, Kubernetes Secrets, SonarQube, Trivy

---

### 7. How do you manage deployments in Kubernetes?

**Answer:**
\*"We package each microservice as a **Helm chart** with values.yaml for environment-specific configs (dev, QA, prod).

For example, Payment Service deployment included:

* **Readiness & Liveness probes** for health checks.
* ConfigMaps & Secrets for configs and credentials.
* HPA for auto-scaling during peak loads.
* **Rolling updates** to avoid downtime.

We deployed using **Helm** or automated **GitOps with ArgoCD**."\*

---

### 8. How do you ensure security in the Billing System?

**Answer:**
\*"Since this system handles financial transactions, we strictly followed **PCI-DSS compliance**. Security measures included:

* Storing sensitive data in **Vault and Kubernetes Secrets**.
* Enforcing **TLS/HTTPS** across all APIs.
* Using Kubernetes **RBAC** for role-based access.
* Running **SonarQube scans** for code quality.
* Performing container **image scanning** using Trivy before deployment.

This ensured both compliance and application security."\*

---

### 9. Give an example of a production issue you faced.

**Answer:**
\*"During a peak billing cycle, the **Payment Service pods crashed** due to a memory leak in a Java microservice.

* I detected the issue via **Prometheus alerts** for high memory usage.
* Using ELK logs, I confirmed memory exceptions in the application.
* I used **Jenkins pipeline rollback** to restore the last stable version.
* Scaled pods temporarily to handle traffic load.

After developers fixed the memory leak, we redeployed and monitored successfully. This minimized customer impact."\*

---

### 10. Why is DevOps important for telecom apps like Billing?

**Answer:**
\*"Telecom applications like Billing & Payment handle **millions of transactions daily**. Without DevOps, managing deployments, scaling, and monitoring would be very difficult.

DevOps ensures:

* Faster and safer releases via **CI/CD automation**.
* **High reliability & uptime** with Kubernetes HA setup.
* **Elastic scaling** during peak usage.
* **Security compliance** for sensitive payment data.
* Proactive monitoring & alerting for quick issue resolution.

This directly improves **customer experience** and reduces **revenue loss**."\*

‚úÖ This modified pack highlights **AWS + DevOps tools (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Terraform, Prometheus, Grafana)** clearly, and avoids AWS-native CI/CD tools.

Do you also want me to prepare a **list of likely follow-up technical questions** (like Terraform state management, Prometheus alerting setup, Jenkins vs GitHub Actions usage, etc.) so you can handle deeper-level discussions in interviews?
