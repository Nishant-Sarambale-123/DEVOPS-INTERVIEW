# üìå **DevOps Interview Questions & Answers (AT\&T Project ‚Äì Billing & Payment System)**

---

## **1. Tell me about your project at AT\&T.**

**Answer:**
\*"I am working for AT\&T on the **Billing & Payment System**, which is a large-scale customer-facing application. Millions of users log in daily to pay bills, recharge, and view invoices. The system is built on a **microservices architecture** (Payment, Billing, Notification, Authentication, etc.) deployed on **Kubernetes**.

As a DevOps engineer, I was responsible for:

* Building **CI/CD pipelines in Jenkins** for automated deployments.
* **Containerizing applications** with Docker.
* Deploying microservices via **Helm charts on Kubernetes clusters**.
* Setting up **monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana** and logging with **ELK/Splunk**.
* Using **Terraform** for Infrastructure as Code to provision cloud resources.
* Managing **secrets securely** using Vault/Kubernetes secrets.

Since this is a payment-critical application, ensuring **99.99% uptime** and PCI-DSS compliance was a key responsibility."\*

---

## **2. Which microservices were part of the Billing System?**

**Answer:**
\*"The system was divided into microservices such as:

* **Billing Service** ‚Äì generates bills.
* **Payment Service** ‚Äì handles transactions.
* **Invoice Service** ‚Äì generates PDFs.
* **Notification Service** ‚Äì sends reminders.
* **Authentication Service** ‚Äì manages user login and security.
* **Plan & Subscription Service** ‚Äì allows plan changes.

Each microservice was containerized using Docker, deployed via Kubernetes, and maintained independently to ensure scalability and high availability."\*

---

## **3. What were your day-to-day tasks as a DevOps engineer?**

**Answer:**
\*"On a daily basis, I:

* Monitored CI/CD pipelines for deployments.
* Worked on new pipeline automation using Jenkins/GitHub Actions.
* Maintained Kubernetes deployments (scaling, rolling updates).
* Configured and monitored alerts (e.g., failed transactions, API latency).
* Troubleshot issues in production using ELK and Prometheus.
* Managed Infrastructure provisioning with Terraform.
* Coordinated with developers to optimize Dockerfiles and Helm charts."\*

---

## **4. How do you ensure high availability in the Billing System?**

**Answer:**
\*"We deployed microservices on **Kubernetes clusters with auto-scaling**. For example, the **Payment Service** is mission-critical, so we used **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler** to handle sudden traffic spikes (like month-end billing).

We also had:

* **Multi-AZ deployments** in the cloud.
* **Load balancers** for distributing traffic.
* **Rolling updates** to avoid downtime during deployments.
* **Alerts in Prometheus** for SLA breaches.

This ensured continuous availability and zero downtime for payments."\*

---

## **5. How do you handle monitoring and logging?**

**Answer:**
\*"For monitoring, we used **Prometheus & Grafana** to track CPU, memory, API response time, and transaction success rates.

For logging, we used **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** and **Splunk** for centralized log management.

Example: If a payment fails, we can trace it via the Payment Service logs in Kibana, correlate with API latency in Grafana, and quickly identify root causes."\*

---

## **6. What DevOps tools do you use in your project?**

**Answer:**

* **CI/CD** ‚Äì Jenkins, GitHub Actions
* **Containerization** ‚Äì Docker
* **Orchestration** ‚Äì Kubernetes, Helm, ArgoCD (for GitOps)
* **Monitoring** ‚Äì Prometheus, Grafana
* **Logging** ‚Äì ELK, Splunk
* **IaC** ‚Äì Terraform, Ansible
* **Security** ‚Äì Vault, Kubernetes Secrets, SonarQube (code quality)

---

## **7. How do you manage deployments in Kubernetes?**

**Answer:**
\*"We package microservices into **Helm charts**, define values.yaml for environments (dev, QA, prod), and deploy using Helm or ArgoCD.

For example, the **Payment Service** is deployed with:

* **readiness/liveness probes** for health checks.
* **ConfigMaps & Secrets** for sensitive data.
* **HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler)** for auto-scaling.
* **Rolling updates** to ensure zero downtime."\*

---

## **8. How do you ensure security in the Billing System?**

**Answer:**
\*"Since this involves payments, we follow **PCI-DSS compliance**. Key practices are:

* Storing secrets in **Vault/Kubernetes Secrets**.
* Using **HTTPS/TLS** for all APIs.
* Role-based access in Kubernetes with **RBAC**.
* **SonarQube & Snyk scans** for code and dependency vulnerabilities.
* Image scanning before deploying containers (Trivy/Anchore)."\*

---

## **9. Give an example of a production issue you faced.**

**Answer:**
\*"Once, during a billing cycle, the **Payment Service pods crashed** due to memory leaks in a microservice. This led to partial payment failures.

I identified the issue via **Prometheus alerts** (high memory usage). Using ELK, I found logs pointing to a Java memory leak.

We rolled back using Jenkins pipeline, restored the last stable version, and scaled pods to handle traffic. Later, developers fixed the code, and we redeployed."\*

---

## **10. Why is DevOps important for telecom apps like Billing?**

**Answer:**
\*"Telecom applications like Billing & Payment handle **millions of daily transactions**. DevOps ensures:

* **Fast releases** (CI/CD automation).
* **Reliability & uptime** (Kubernetes HA setup).
* **Scalability** during peak loads.
* **Security** for sensitive payment data.
* **Proactive monitoring** to detect failures before customers do.

Without DevOps, manual deployments and lack of monitoring would lead to downtime, revenue loss, and poor customer experience."\*
