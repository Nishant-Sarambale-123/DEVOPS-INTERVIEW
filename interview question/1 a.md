Here are your earlier Q&A **in short but detailed enough notes** — best for interview preparation.

---

# 🟦 **1. CORS Full Form**

**CORS = Cross-Origin Resource Sharing**
Allows a browser to load resources (images, APIs, etc.) from another domain.

---

# 🟦 **2. What is stored in etcd (Kubernetes DB)?**

etcd stores **entire Kubernetes cluster state**, including:

* Pods (desired + current state)
* Deployments, ReplicaSets
* Services, Endpoints
* ConfigMaps, Secrets
* Nodes info
* Roles, RoleBindings
* Network policies
* PersistentVolumes metadata
* API object definitions

➡️ **If etcd is lost, the cluster state is lost.**

---

# 🟦 **3. Can you change private IP of EC2?**

* **Primary private IP** → ❌ **Cannot change** (fixed for life of the instance)
* **Secondary private IP** → ✅ Can add, remove, or modify
* Elastic IP → can move between instances

---

# 🟦 **4. Backend services for Lambda**

Lambda can be triggered or used with:

### **Event Sources / Triggers**

* API Gateway
* S3 (PUT/DELETE events)
* DynamoDB Streams
* SQS
* SNS
* EventBridge
* Kinesis
* CloudWatch Events / Schedules
* Cognito
* ALB (Lambda target)

### **Services Lambda can access**

* RDS / Aurora via RDS Proxy
* VPC resources
* S3
* DynamoDB
* Secrets Manager
* Parameter Store

---

# 🟦 **5. Mutability vs Immutability in ECR tags**

**Mutable Tags**

* Same tag can be overwritten with a new image
* Example: `latest`
* Risk: Deployments may pull different images with same tag

**Immutable Tags**

* Once pushed, tag cannot be changed
* Ensures consistent deployments
* Good for production

---

# 🟦 **6. What is enabled by default in ECR?**

* **Scan on push is enabled by default** (but can be disabled)
* Private registry by default
* Tag immutability → **OFF by default**

---

# 🟦 **7. Pod communication between two namespaces**

Pods communicate via **Service FQDN**:

```
<service-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local
```

Example:

```
curl myapp.default.svc.cluster.local
```

This allows cross-namespace service access.

---

# 🟦 **8. In deployment, you asked for 5 pods but only 3 are running — who ensures 5 must run?**

**ReplicaSet Controller (inside kube-controller-manager)**

* Ensures desired replicas = actual replicas
* Creates missing pods
* Deletes extra pods

➡️ Responsible for maintaining the **desired state**.

---

# 🟦 **9. Why use Secret instead of ConfigMap?**

* ConfigMaps store data **in plain text** → visible to everyone
* Secrets are **Base64 encoded by default**
* Secrets can be encrypted using **encryption at rest**
* Secret access is controlled via **RBAC**
* Secrets are **not logged** by kubelet
* Mounted as tmpfs → not written to disk

➡️ ConfigMaps = Non-sensitive data
➡️ Secrets = Sensitive data (passwords, API keys, TLS certs)

---

# 🟦 **10. How to enable encryption for Secret?**

Edit API server with encryption config:

### Step 1: Create file

```yaml
apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1
kind: EncryptionConfiguration
resources:
  - resources:
      - secrets
    providers:
      - aescbc:
          keys:
            - name: key1
              secret: <base64-encoded-32-byte-key>
      - identity: {}
```

### Step 2: Add flag in kube-apiserver:

```
--encryption-provider-config=/etc/kubernetes/encryption-config.yaml
```

### Step 3: Restart API server

### Step 4: Re-encrypt secrets:

```
kubectl get secrets -A -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```

---

# 🟦 **11. Command to watch pod live**

### Watch pod status

```
kubectl get pods -w
```

### Watch pod logs

```
kubectl logs -f <pod-name>
```
