Perfect 👍 You’re asking about the **Argo CD deployment manifest** (to deploy your app on Kubernetes via Argo CD) and **detailed notes** for interview prep. Let’s go step by step.

# 📘 Notes on Argo CD Deployment File

## 1. What is Argo CD?

* **GitOps-based continuous delivery tool**.
* Watches a **Git repository** containing Kubernetes manifests (YAMLs).
* Syncs your cluster with the desired state in Git.
* Instead of `kubectl apply`, Argo CD applies manifests automatically.

👉 In your CI/CD pipeline above:

* GitHub Action updates the image tag in **infra repo** (`deployment.yaml`).
* Argo CD sees the change and deploys automatically.

---

## 2. Key Concepts in Argo CD

1. **Application CRD** → Tells Argo CD:

   * Where to pull manifests from (Git/Helm repo).
   * What to deploy (path, chart, kustomize).
   * Where to deploy (cluster + namespace).

2. **Sync Policy** → Determines whether sync is:

   * Manual (need to click in UI).
   * Automatic (immediate deployment).

3. **Self-Healing** → If someone manually changes the cluster, Argo CD reverts it back.

👉 In interview:

* If asked *“Why Argo CD instead of plain GitHub Actions deploy?”* →
  Because Argo CD provides **declarative, auditable, and auto-healing deployments**.

## 3. Argo CD Deployment YAML (Application Resource)

Here’s a typical **Application manifest** for your app `actapp`:

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: actapp
  namespace: argocd   # Argo CD itself runs in 'argocd' namespace
spec:
  project: default

  source:
    repoURL: https://github.com/your-org/infra-repo.git
    targetRevision: main        # branch to watch
    path: k8s                   # folder inside repo with manifests

  destination:
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
    namespace: actapp

  syncPolicy:
    automated:                  # Enables auto-sync (GitOps style)
      prune: true                # Remove old resources not in Git
      selfHeal: true             # Revert manual changes in cluster
    syncOptions:
    - CreateNamespace=true       # Create namespace if not exists
```

---

## 4. Notes on this Manifest

* **apiVersion/kind**: Every Argo CD app is an `Application` CRD.
* **metadata.name**: Unique identifier of the app in Argo CD UI.
* **namespace: argocd**: Must be deployed in the `argocd` namespace.
* **source.repoURL**: Git repository URL where manifests are stored.
* **source.path**: Path inside repo (`k8s/`) containing manifests like `deployment.yaml`, `service.yaml`.
* **destination**:

  * `server`: Cluster endpoint. Use `https://kubernetes.default.svc` for in-cluster.
  * `namespace`: Namespace where app will run.
* **syncPolicy.automated**:

  * `prune: true` → Deletes resources removed from Git.
  * `selfHeal: true` → If someone manually edits resources in the cluster, Argo CD fixes it.
  * `CreateNamespace=true` → Automatically creates namespace.

👉 In interviews, mention:

* **Manual vs Auto Sync**: Some companies prefer manual sync in production (for safer rollouts).
* **GitOps benefit**: Version-controlled deployments, rollback possible by reverting Git commit.

---

## 5. Typical Flow with This Setup

1. Developer commits code → GitHub Actions builds Docker image → pushes to ECR.
2. GitHub Actions updates `k8s/deployment.yaml` in `infra-repo` with new image tag.
3. Argo CD detects the change in Git → syncs automatically → deploys new version to cluster.
4. If deployment fails or is modified manually, Argo CD rolls it back or fixes drift.

✅ **Final Deployment File for Argo CD (Application CRD)**

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: actapp
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  project: default

  source:
    repoURL: https://github.com/your-org/infra-repo.git
    targetRevision: main
    path: k8s

  destination:
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
    namespace: actapp

  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: true
    syncOptions:
    - CreateNamespace=true
```

👉 Do you also want me to create a **sample `k8s/deployment.yaml`** (with placeholders for image) that matches this Argo CD Application, so you can show both in interview?
